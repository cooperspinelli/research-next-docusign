routes


WHAT VLAD DID

1. /form
    - takes form request
    - creates envelope
        - getEnvelopesAPI: access token in backend
        - makeEnvelope: create and return envelope
    - creates recipient view
        - makeRecipientViewRequest
    - returns redirect to envelope
    - has access to

2. checkToken
    - makes request if no token or token is expired

WHAT WE WILL DO

two distinct things

    1) getting the api key and having access to it in the places we need
        (both on form submit (just in case) and beforehand)

Server:

what should happen when the form submits
make an api call with the from inputs. API responds with url to redirect to
or an error message

options:
    make api request which does 2 and returns url for redirect
    make a route which handles the form

Client:
renders form and manages for inputs (cotrolled component)
